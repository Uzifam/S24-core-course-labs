### Load Balancing Improvement

The first pod received a greater number of visits compared to the second pod, likely because the minikube service primarily directed requests to it, while the second pod mainly processed health check requests. Introducing a load balancer could have resulted in a more balanced distribution of traffic between the two pods.

### Ordering Guarantees

Ordering guarantees are unnecessary for the application. We have the flexibility to start multiple pods simultaneously since each pod operates independently of others.
