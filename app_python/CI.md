# GitHub Actions Workflow Best Practices

## Workflow Name
- **Descriptive Naming**: The workflow is named `code quality test`, providing clear insight into its purpose.

## Trigger
- **Event Triggering**: The workflow is triggered on `push` events, ensuring automation upon code changes.

## Job Separation
- **Modularization**: The workflow is divided into two jobs: `test_and_lint_code` and `docker_build_and_push_image`, aiding in organization and parallelization of tasks.

## Runner Environment
- **Environment Selection**: The runner environment `ubuntu-latest` is utilized, ensuring compatibility and leveraging the latest features.

## Python Environment Setup
- **Python Version Management**: `actions/setup-python` is used to set up the Python environment with version `3.12`, ensuring consistency.

## Dependency Management
- **Dependency Installation**: Project dependencies are installed via `pip install -r app_python/requirements.txt`, ensuring reproducibility and streamlined setup.

## Code Quality Checks
- **Static Analysis**: Tools like Flake8 and pytest are employed to enforce code quality standards and verify functionality.

## Docker Integration
- **Docker Buildx Setup**: Docker Buildx is set up using `docker/setup-buildx-action@v1`, facilitating multi-platform builds and improved performance.

## Secure Credential Handling
- **Credential Management**: Sensitive information such as Docker Hub credentials is securely managed using GitHub Secrets to prevent exposure.
